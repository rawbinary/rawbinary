## About Me

💬 A self-taught coder who started coding at the age of 12.

🔭 [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is my bread with type-safety as the butter.

💻 Love for techs with type-safety; [tRPC](https://trpc.io), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), [Zod](https://zod.dev/), [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg)

💔 [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is the unrequited love.

🍀 Worked with PHP and C# in the past, and still when required.
