## About Me

💬 A self-taught coder who started coding at the age of 12, gathered knowledge on HTML, CSS, JS, C#, PHP, and TypeScript.

🔭 I currently work on TypeScript with technologies such as Next.js, Auth.js, tRPC, Prisma, Tailwind, etc.

🌱 I'm currently learning Rust out of curiosity and love for the language.
